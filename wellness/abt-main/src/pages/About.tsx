                  Activate Body Therapy was founded in 2019 by Ismail Sina
                  with a simple yet powerful mission: to provide exceptional
                  therapeutic care that addresses the root causes of pain and
                  discomfort, not just the symptoms.
                </p>
                <p>
                  What started as a small practice has grown into a trusted
                  wellness destination, serving thousands of clients from
                  professional athletes to busy professionals, new mothers to
                  seniors.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Today, our team of certified therapists continues to uphold
                  Dr. Mitchell's founding principles: personalized care, clinical
                  excellence, and a genuine commitment to each client's wellness
